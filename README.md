## General info
This project can be used by beginners to learn and play around neural networks without the need of setting up in their local system. The motivation for this project is to get a head start in the field of Deep Learning and learn how to build Recurrent Neural Networks with Gated Recurrent Units. 

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.7
* Keras - version 2.4.3
* Gensim - version 3.8.3

## Setup
The setup for this project is really simple. Open the Google colaboratory link in the .ipynb file uploaded.

## Content
The jupyter notebook in this project implements a custom recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units. The Glove word embedding is used to perform transfer learning.
